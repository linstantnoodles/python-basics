# Python crash course for programmers

The ideal student for this course:

* Has written programs in python or different languages before. Understands basic programming concepts like variables and loops as well as object oriented programming concepts like encapsulation and inheritance.
* Wants to master the fundamentals of the language and be more productive (most important).

My goals as a course creator:

* Cover the essential concepts in plain english.
* Give examples. An example is worth a thousand words.
* Give quizzes and exercises. Active learning is better than passive.

Note: Alot of the world still use python 2.7. The material will be in python 3 by default, but I will highlight differences where it's relevant.
