# Python Course 

## Aim: Curriculum for going from zero to hero in python for programmers

In this course the focus will be on language fundamentals. Not machine dependent things like how to install python or manage packages. I will touch on things like package management and even suggest third party tools here and there for exercises and projects but that will not be the focus.

The ideal student for this course: 

* Has written programs in python or different languages before. Understands basic programming concepts like variables and loops as well as object oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance. I will not be explaining what variables are or the difference between a class and an instance of a class. 
* Wants to become fluent in writing python either for work / school / hobby / interviews whatever. 
* Likes things explained in plain english.

My goals as a course creator: 

* Provide you with the curriculum to go from "I know no python" or "I'm ... kinda ... familiar with python" or "I have to constantly look up the language documentation in python" to "I'm badass at python"
* Give plenty of examples. An example is worth a thousand words.

Note: okay so a lot of the world still use python 2.7. The material will be in python3 by default. Any relevant differences between 3 and 2 I WILL HIGHLIGHT.
