So this is going to be an experiment. 

My favorite feature in python are list comprehensions (by far). 
It's uniquely python. 
It's pretty popularly searched: 

python list comprehension
10K â€“ 100K

avg monthly. 

Theory: if I make a site _specifically_ and singularly focused on this topic, it will become highly ranked. I have confidence in this b.c I'v edone this w. stackoverflow questions. 
Theory 2: this topic can be the basis for other guides / content on Python.

Overarching goal: showcase my teaching style (clear and comprehensive). establish reputation for providing _deep_ expertise. showcase a framework for understadning something deeply (examples, abstraction levels, visuals).


questions:

* what should the domain name be? 
* should this fall under some kind of theme? rather than just being an exhaustive reference / guide - 
	* possible themes: 1 minute guides, 10 minute guides, 10 hour guides
	* organized by questions: 

1. Create a list of the top 10 python list comprehension guides (including stack overflow)
	* what do they cover? what do they not cover?
	* how many words are they, roughly?
	* how many views / comments / roughly how popular is the post? 
	* list these by ranking on google
	* where can I share the link?


* how hsould this site be organized? how do you start promoting it?
